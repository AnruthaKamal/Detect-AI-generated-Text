# Text Classification Project: Detecting AI-Generated Text using Logistic Regression and Bag of Words Technique

## Overview
This project aims to classify text data into two categories: AI-generated and human-generated. The classification is done using logistic regression and bag of words technique. The dataset used for training and testing the model is sourced from a Kaggle competition.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is obtained from a Kaggle competition and consists of a collection of text data labeled as either AI-generated or human-generated. The dataset is split into training and testing sets for model development and evaluation.

## Model
The classification model is built using logistic regression and bag of words technique. Logistic regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for binary classification tasks. Bag of words technique is employed to convert text data into numerical features for input into the logistic regression model.

## Deployment
This project is deployed using Streamlit. You can access the deployed application at [https://genuineverify.streamlit.app/](https://genuineverify.streamlit.app/).

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Results
The performance of the model is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. The model achieves satisfactory performance in distinguishing between AI-generated and human-generated text.
